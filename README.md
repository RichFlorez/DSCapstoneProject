# Coursera Data Science Capstone Project

## Word Prediction App

This is my Coursera Data Science Capstone project repository. The goal of this project was to build a Shiny application that will predict the next word of a short phrase for a mobile device user in order to save time on keystrokes. 

It utilzes the following methods, techniques, and applications:
- NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- Corpus creation
- Tokenization
- N-Grams
- Katz Backoff Algorithms
- Shiny
- WordCloud
- RPresenter
