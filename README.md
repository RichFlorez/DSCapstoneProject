# Coursera Data Science Capstone Project

# Word Prediction App

This is my Coursera Data Science Capstone project repository. The goal of this project was to build a Shiny application that will predict the next word of a short phrase for a mobile device user in order to save time on keystrokes. 

It utilzes the following methods and techniques:
- NLP
- Corpus Creation
- N-Grams
- Katz Backoff Algorithm
- WordCloud
